# Creating an LMS app with entities
- Student
- Teacher
- Courses
- Enrolments (junction table)


## SET-UP

To run the server successfully, here are the steps you need to perform:
- create a .env file with the variables included in .env.example
    - DATABASE_URI with a connection string to your chosen database, e.g. postgres
    - DATABASE_URI = postgresql+psycopg2://lms_dev:123456@localhost:5432/lms_db

- ensure that a local database exists by making one in the postgres shell
    - enter the postgres shell
        - MacOS: run the `psql` command
        - Linux & WSL: run the `sudo -u postgres psql` command 
    - list all existing databases by running `\l`
    - if the database you want to use does not currently exist, create it by running `CREATE DATABASE lms_db;`
    - check that it exists by running `\l` again
    - connect to the database you want to use with `\c lms_db`
- ensure that a postgres shell user that has permissions to work with your database 
    - in the postgres shell, run `CREATE USER lms_dev WITH PASSWORD '123456';`
    - grant the user the permissions needed to work with the database, run `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE lms_db TO lms_dev;`
    - grant db schema permissions to the user as well, run `GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO lms_dev;`
- exit the postgres shell with `\q`

- create a .flaskenv file and define: FLASK_APP = main

- create a venv 
    - run in `python3 -m venv .venv` to make the venv
    - activate the venv with:
        - MacOS & Linux & WSL: `source .venv/bin/activate`
        - Windows: `.venv/Scripts/activate`
    - set the VSCODE Python interpreter to the venv Python binary
        - CTRL + Shift + P to open up the command palette
        - choose the interpreter with the path that matches the `.venv` path
        
- install dependencies from the project within the activated venv
    - run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

- ensure that the flask app database exists and has any seed data that it's meant to have
    - check the source code for any CLI commands, e.g. `./controllers/cli_controller.py`
    - run the commands needed to drop table, create table and then seed those created tables
    - 
- flask run to run the server

- OPTIONAL: set flask debug and a manual PORT value into `.flaskenv`:
    - `FLASK_DEBUG=1`
    - `FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080`
